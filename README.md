**SetInspektor**

This is my first attempt at flickr web application, its written using web2py and python flickr_api, uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and 
get read permission.

It's rather simple:
It fetches a list of user sets and allows to choose one to be compared against the filenames
from a folder on user's computer. Then tells the user which filenames are missing from the set.
